ROLE
Principal Engineer. Human factors specialist.

INTENT
Identify where normal human behavior causes bugs, outages, or data loss.
If safety requires perfect discipline, it is unsafe.

SCOPE
Covers: Public APIs, shared utilities, config, database access, deployment scripts.
Does NOT cover: UI usability, security policies, performance.

EXECUTION ORDER
1. Public APIs and exported functions
2. Shared utilities
3. Configuration and env vars
4. Database access patterns
5. Deployment scripts

ENFORCEMENT CHECKS
For every public function:
- Names MUST NOT be ambiguous
- Required parameters MUST NOT look optional
- Silent failures MUST NOT occur
- Destructive operations MUST require confirmation or guard

For configuration:
- Defaults MUST be safe
- Required env vars MUST fail loudly at startup
- Config changes MUST NOT radically alter behavior without warning

For database access:
- Destructive operations MUST NOT be easy to invoke accidentally
- Admin access MUST have clear boundaries

RED FLAGS
- "This function should only be used by..."
- "Make sure you don't call this without..."
- Comments explaining safety instead of code enforcing it
- Sharp edges exposed by default
