ROLE
Principal Mobile Engineer and Design Systems Architect (20+ years). Removing all "AI-generated" visual, layout, and copy patterns.

INTENT
Redesign ALL screens so the app feels human-designed, editorially intentional, and comparable to top-tier consumer apps — not AI-generated templates or generic UI kits.

NOTE: This is a Category C (workflow) prompt. It is procedural, not analytical.

SCOPE
Covers:
- Identifying and removing AI-slop patterns (layout + copy)
- Removing low-information UI sections
- Defining tokens and shared components
- Redesigning screens with intentional hierarchy
- Rewriting on-screen copy to be concrete and human

Does NOT cover:
- Current state analysis (run UI audit prompts first)
- General redesign without anti-slop focus (→ mobile-ui-redesign-prompt)

ANTI-AI-SLOP DIRECTIVE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

You MUST actively remove:
- Generic template layouts
- "Card grid everywhere" designs with no hierarchy
- Symmetrical sections that look auto-generated
- Overly dense screens trying to fill space
- Repeated UI blocks with minor variations
- Vague, motivational, or marketing-fluff copy
- Generic headings: "Welcome back", "Unlock your potential", "Everything you need in one place"
- Filler text that does not add concrete information

If a screen looks like it could have been generated in one prompt, it is unacceptable.

REFERENCE QUALITY BAR

The redesign MUST feel closer to:
- High-quality consumer apps with strong taste
- Clean editorial hierarchy and intentional spacing
- Confident UI that does not rely on gimmicks
- Interfaces that are calm, readable, and purposeful

Do NOT emulate:
- AI website/app generators
- Generic Flutter UI templates
- Over-boxed "dashboard" screens
- Overuse of shadows, gradients, and noisy backgrounds
- Empty "pretty" sections that communicate nothing

EXECUTION ORDER (LOCKED)
1. Identify AI-slop patterns (layout + copy)
2. Remove low-information UI sections
3. Define tokens and shared components
4. Redesign screens with intentional hierarchy and calm spacing
5. Rewrite all on-screen copy to be concrete and human
6. Verify no hardcoded values remain

Do NOT add visual flourish before fixing structure and copy.

DESIGN SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)

You MUST use global design tokens.
DO NOT hardcode: spacing values, font sizes/weights, colors, radii, elevations, icon sizes.

Tokens MUST exist and be referenced via ThemeData / extensions / centralized constants:
- Spacing scale (xs, sm, md, lg, xl…)
- Typography scale (display, title, body, caption)
- Color palette (bg, surface, primary, secondary, error, text variants)
- Radius scale
- Elevation/shadow scale
- Button variants and sizes
- Card variants
- Icon sizing scale

SCREEN REDESIGN REQUIREMENTS

For EVERY screen:

Preserve functional intent:
- Same data
- Same actions
- Same navigation outcomes

Replace template structure with intentional hierarchy:
- Identify the primary user goal on that screen
- Make the primary content obvious
- Demote secondary content
- Remove redundant sections

Use calm, deliberate spacing:
- Less clutter
- Fewer boxes
- Use whitespace as structure
- Stop using cards as the only organizational tool

Improve interaction patterns:
- Predictable action placement
- Strong primary/secondary button hierarchy
- Consistent form patterns and validation UI

If content blocks can be rearranged without changing meaning, the layout is generic and must be redesigned.

TYPOGRAPHY & COPY QUALITY (CRITICAL)

You MUST rewrite UI text to:
- Be concrete, not abstract
- Be short, not fluffy
- Avoid buzzwords and motivational filler
- Sound written by a human who understands the product

Rules:
- No marketing tone inside product screens
- No "AI-sounding" phrases
- No repeating the same idea in different words
- Remove text that conveys no new information

Every label and description must earn its space.

LAYOUT & COMPOSITION RULES (MOBILE-SPECIFIC)
- Avoid uniform stacking of identical cards
- Use sections with clear titles only when needed
- Prefer fewer, stronger UI elements per screen
- Ensure information density matches mobile usage (quick scanning)
- Use consistent safe areas, padding, and rhythm across screens
- Avoid decorative noise (unnecessary gradients, shadows, shapes)

A good mobile screen feels calm and obvious.

STATE DESIGN (MUST BE HUMAN-QUALITY)

For every screen:
- Empty states are informative and specific
- Loading states do not jump layout unnecessarily
- Error states are actionable and calm
- Success feedback is clear and not childish

Avoid generic empty-state text like "No data yet."

FLUTTER IMPLEMENTATION RULES
- Define tokens first (ThemeData + extensions)
- Create reusable components before redesigning screens
- No per-screen one-off styling
- Keep widget trees readable and maintainable

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT)

Do not narrate.

Output ONLY:
1. Screens with AI-slop issues identified
2. Layout patterns removed or replaced
3. Sections removed entirely (with reason)
4. Screens redesigned (intent explained briefly)
5. Copy rewritten (before → after for key screens)
6. Files changed/created (paths)
7. Any compromises requiring product decisions

If any screen remains generic, state exactly why.

DONE CONDITION
Redesign is complete when:
- The app feels authored, not generated
- The UI avoids generic template patterns
- Hierarchy is calm and confident
- Global design tokens are used everywhere
- Copy is concise and specific
- The app feels comparable to top consumer mobile apps
